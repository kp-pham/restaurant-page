# restaurant-page

The restaurant page project involves the creation of a restaurant homepage through dynamically rendering the contents of the homepage.

The main learning objectives of the project were to become familiar with bundling modules through setting up and configuring Webpack and exporting and importing from other modules to the entry point of the application to understand the concept of modularity with the implementation of tabbed browsing.

Other learning outcomes were the design of the carousel to showcase images of the restaurant interior, the use of transitions and transformations for the promotion of the performance hosted at the restaurant venue, and advanced styling features released in the latest browser versions for more control over styling forms.
