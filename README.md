# restaurant-page

The restaurant page project involves the creation of a restaurant homepage through dynamically rendering the contents of the homepage.

The main learning objectives of the project were to become familiar with bundling modules through the set-up and configuration of Webpack and exporting modules and importing from other modules to the entry point of the application to understand the concept of modularity with the implementation of tabbed browsing.

Other learning outcomes of the project beyond the learning objectives and practice of concepts learned from the Foundations and Intermediate HTML and CSS courses were the design and implementation of the slideshow/carousel for the images of the interior of the restaurant and the use of animations for the advertisement of the upcoming performance at the restaurant on the homepage of the restaurant and the use of more advanced CSS properties to overcome the limitations of the styling for form controls set by the operating system on the contact form for the restaurant homepage.

The showcase of the design of the restaurant homepage can be found at the bottom of the page.
